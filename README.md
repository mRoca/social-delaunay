# social-delaunay

This is a test project using the [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation)
to transform an image into a grid of triangles.

## TODO

* Add social network data (visits, ...) to update dynamicaly the grid.
* Find a way to not include vendors in the repo (actually inluded to run on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) without bower)
